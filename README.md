# Tweet Search

## Overview
This is an application powered by Twitter Search API which performs search jobs for a specific word. It is built on Symfony2 framework using PHP. 

## Objectives
I built this so that I could find out what it's like to develop an application on the latest "Symfony2." This is a very simple application which would only require one file of plain program to get the job done; nevertheless I intentionally (and verbosely) created several files so that processes can move around the Symfony2's MVC framework.  

The next step hasn't been decide. I might add something for security, or I might try out a variety of dependency injections.

### Note
Symfony2 comes with a demo application which is, in this repo, is located under `tweet-search/src/Acme/DemoBundle`. I copied and directly overwrote it in order to create my own application under `tweet-search/src/Acme/TweetBundle`. There is a chance some unnecessary files and configuration are still existing in `TweetBundle`. I will take care of them as I find time to do it.

Also, I will get it up and running on a PaaS shortly.
